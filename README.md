# This is sample Microservice API folder structure, still a draft...

Trying to create common folder structure for the microservices projects (NodeJS/ExpressJS)

## This folder structure would address the management of these concerns

- Source code
- Documentation
- Testing artifacts
- Configuration
- Dockerization 
- CICD Config and deployment scripts

## To run locally run these commands

### In development mode

   ```bash
   npm install 
   node app.js
   ```

### In production mode

   ```bash
   npm install 
   export NODE_ENV=production
   node app.js
   ```
